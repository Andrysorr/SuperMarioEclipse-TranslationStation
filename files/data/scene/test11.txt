     0	= Mario!\n
	+ Please, do come in.
     1	= You know what you're\n
	+ blocking right now?\n
	+ The sunset.
     2	= How splendid.\n
	+ This vacation was\n
	+ SUCH a fine idea!
     3	= You know what?\n
	+ I don't think they\n
	+ ever have drinks here!
     4	= I'm so thirsty, I could\n
	+ drink some of that\n
	+ disgusting goop...
     5	= Yippee! C'mon\n
	+ everybody! Dance!\n
	+ Do the doot-dance!
     6	= This is the best!\n
	+ I can't stop!\n
	+ I'm dooting out!
     7	= Whew... It's about\n
	+ time to go back to\n
	+ the room...
     8	= I'm pretty sure we're\n
	+ getting restocked in\n
	+ just a moment...
     9	= I'm getting hungry...
     a	= I think I may have\n
	+ lost some weight...
     b	= Oh! The freedom!\n
	+ The sunset! Running\n
	+ around is amazing!
     c	= So, he finally\n
	+ gets it...\n
	+ Tee hee hee!
     d	= Woo, sunset dancin'...\n
	+ Gonna dance all night!\n
	+ Doot-doot!\n
	+ All night dancin'...\n
	+ No sleepin' tonight!\n
	+ Dootie-doot!\n
     e	= My feet hurt, and my\n
	+ arms feel like lead.\n
	+ Oh, and DOOT-DOOT!
     f	= If we keep this up,\n
	+ someone may notice...\n
	+ De doot-doot!
    10	= Oh, this is great!\n
	+ Thanks to you, I've\n
	+ still got a job!
    11	= I hope my pants\n
	+ survived the\n
	+ ordeal intact...
    12	= I don't know why, but\n
	+ this was a safe place\n
	+ when the goop fell...
    13	= I was under the roof,\n
	+ so I didn't get\n
	+ drenched in slime.
    14	= Excuse me, sir. Could\n
	+ you step back a bit?\n
	+ Doot doot, doot doot!
    15	= Ricco's the kind of\n
	+ place songs are\n
	+ written about...
    16	= So, NOBODY'S selling\n
	+ fruit around here?
    17	= I want to swim with\n
	+ a duck ring, too!
    18	= Even if I bought this,\n
	+ I couldn't eat it all\n
	+ at once.\n
	+ I wonder if they\n
	+ sell it in smaller\n
	+ portions...
    19	= Oh, hey! Could you do\n
	+ me a favor and get up\n
	+ on top of this tank?\n
	+ There's a switch up\n
	+ there that I'd like\n
	+ you to jump on.\n
	+ It looks like a piece\n
	+ of fruit's jammed\n
	+ in the pipe.
    1a	= You actually managed\n
	+ to talk to the three\n
	+ duck-ring riders?\n
	+ You're amazing!\n
	+ Here you go! This is\n
	+ your reward!
    1b	= That swing won't\n
	+ move even if you push\n
	+ it. It's just too big.\n
	+ Hey! That's quite a\n
	+ device you've got on\n
	+ your back!
    1c	= Fluffy fluffy fluff...
    1d	= Pianta Hot Spring\n
	+ \n
	+ --OPEN--\n
	+ Refresh body\n
	+ and spirit\n
	+ with a dip!\n
    1e	= Now, you and I\n
	+ shall race to get there\n
	+ the fastest! Yes!\n
	+ My personal record is\n
	+ \z{602,0}\n
	+ Impressive, eh?\n
	+ Are you at the ready?\n
	+ Then get set!\n
	+ AND GOOOOOOOO!!
    1f	= Grrrr! Yes, GRRRR!\n
	+ That was not so bad!\n
	+ You are quick! Yes!\n
	+ I suppose, maybe I\n
	+ underestimated you\n
	+ a small bit. Perhaps.\n
	+ You try again after\n
	+ you have practiced\n
	+ more. Until then...
    20	= You are nothing but\n
	+ a rank amateur! You\n
	+ are like a fat snail!\n
	+ Come now! Dig down\n
	+ and show me what\n
	+ you have, mustachio!\n
	+ I will be waiting when\n
	+ you are ready to try\n
	+ again! Until then...
    21	= That is all I have\n
	+ to say to you!\n
	+ Now, be off!
    22	= Pianta Hot Spring\n
	+ \n
	+ --OPEN--\n
	+ Refresh body\n
	+ and spirit\n
	+ with a dip!\n
    23	= Don't be late!\n
	+ The mayor's waiting!
    24	= Pianta Hot Spring\n
	+ \n
	+ --OPEN--\n
	+ Refresh body\n
	+ and spirit\n
	+ with a dip!\n
    25	= It's your fault that\n
	+ our Shine Sprites left\n
	+ and the sky got dark!
    26	= I thought I told\n
	+ you...\n
	+ NO FREE SAMPLES!!!
    27	= Running around and\n
	+ getting all sweaty\n
	+ is nice, but...\n
	+ You can eat these\n
	+ and get just as\n
	+ sweaty! Yes sir!
    28	= Delicious fruits need\n
	+ the sun to live...\n
	+ At least, ours do.\n
	+ And at this rate,\n
	+ we may never have\n
	+ fruit again.\n
	+ Oh, where have all\n
	+ the Shine Sprites\n
	+ gone off to?!
    29	= What's that?\n
	+ Hold on!\n
	+ I smell it!\n
	+ Something's going to\n
	+ happen! But where?!\n
	+ Where is it?!
    2a	= It sure is dark!\n
	+ Is this the daytime?\n
	+ Are cities all dark?
    2b	= Now where's that\n
	+ big ol' Shine?\n
	+ \n
	+ The guidebook says\n
	+ it's like the shining\n
	+ eye of Isle Delfino!
    2c	= Unforgivable! I have\n
	+ HAD it! Someone\n
	+ ruined my wall!\n
	+ What does "M"\n
	+ mean, anyway!? And\n
	+ haven't we met?
    2d	= So it's true... Our\n
	+ Shine Sprites really\n
	+ have left us...\n
	+ I'm taking it\n
	+ pretty hard, to tell\n
	+ you the truth.\n
	+ I just wish the sun\n
	+ would return and\n
	+ tan us like before!
    2e	= So you're probably\n
	+ still involved in\n
	+ some naughty stuff...\n
	+ Right? Like huge\n
	+ disasters and stuff?\n
	+ Yup, I knew it!
    2f	= So the model for\n
	+ the Grand Pianta\n
	+ was your ancestor?\n
	+ That's ridiculous!\n
	+ Seriously, come on!\n
	+ You are such a liar!\n
	+ It's because of liars\n
	+ like you that our\n
	+ Shine Sprites left us!
    30	= I'm NOT lying! \n
	+ I saw the plans for\n
	+ the statue!\n
	+ Why don't you use\n
	+ your ears and start\n
	+ listening to me!\n
	+ It's because of\n
	+ squid-brains like you\n
	+ that it got dark!
    31	= Hm? Naw, the boat\n
	+ can't leave yet. You\n
	+ have to improvise!
    32	= These repairs are\n
	+ really rough, I'm\n
	+ telling you!\n
	+ It'll be a while...
    33	= I was shipwrecked\n
	+ and washed up here\n
	+ three years ago.\n
	+ I often think about\n
	+ the far shore, but I\n
	+ can't swim...\n
	+ I've never left this\n
	+ little island. Isn't\n
	+ that just awful?
