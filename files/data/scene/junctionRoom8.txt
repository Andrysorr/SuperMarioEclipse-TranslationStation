	+ on this train before?\n
	+ \n
	+ I travel with my family\n
	+ a lot on it.\n
	+ \n
	+ We get to see a lot\n
	+ of cool spots.\n
	+ \n
	+ I like trying food in\n
	+ different places.\n
	+ \n
	+ This train has a\n
	+ nice view.\n
	+ \n
	+ So I get to see some\n
	+ cool things.\n
	+ \n
	+ Not too long ago we\n
	+ stayed at a tropical\n
	+ hotel with a beach.\n
	+ I swear I saw a ghost!\n
	+ \n
	+ \n
	+ I bet someone was\n
	+ pranking me.\n
	+ \n
	+ I like jokes\n
	+ and pranks.\n
	+ \n
	+ Wanna hear a joke??\n
	+ \n
	+ \n
	+ What does a Noki say\n
	+ When they can't make\n
	+ up their mind?...\n
	+ Nokie Dokie!\n
	+ \n
	+ \n
	+ I have one more!\n
	+ \n
	+ \n
	+ What's the Piantas'\n
	+ number one rule?\n
	+ \n
	+ The right to\n
	+ tree speech!\n
	+ \n
	+ My mother said I was\n
	+ "grounded".\n
	+ \n
	+ For being grounded\n
	+ I'm really going places\n
	+ in this train.
