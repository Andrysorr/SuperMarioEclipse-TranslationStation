     0	= I'll have you know\n
	+ that if you use the\n
	+ Dune Buds wisely...\n
	+ ...you can reach\n
	+ heights you never\n
	+ would normally.\n
	+ You know, like the\n
	+ tops of huts and\n
	+ places like that...
     1	= We need to get those\n
	+ mirrors back into\n
	+ position! Now!
     2	= I'm so worried about\n
	+ the egg! Aaaaaaaa!
     3	= OK, here's what we\n
	+ need to do to save\n
	+ the egg:\n
	+ We need to get that\n
	+ big green caterpillar\n
	+ thing off the tower.\n
	+ To do that, we need\n
	+ to move the mirrors\n
	+ back into position.\n
	+ So, we need to get\n
	+ rid of those Plungelos\n
	+ that are up there!\n
	+ Then the heat from\n
	+ the mirrors will make\n
	+ the caterpillar move!\n
	+ Whew! What a plan!
     4	= This guy is all talk!\n
	+ He never tries to do\n
	+ anything himself!
     5	= Awww, I don't like the\n
	+ looks of this!
     6	= Those things up on\n
	+ the mirrors...\n
	+ \n
	+ I wonder if you could\n
	+ shake 'em off by\n
	+ rocking the mirrors...
     7	= If we don't do \n
	+ something quick, the\n
	+ Sand Bird won't hatch!
     8	= If you look closely,\n
	+ you'll see two kinds\n
	+ of palm trees.\n
	+ You can climb to the\n
	+ top of the ones\n
	+ without spiky leaves.
     9	= How about squirting\n
	+ those mirror-walkers?\n
	+ Think that'll do it?
     a	= I've been observing\n
	+ the egg for years, but\n
	+ this is a first!\n
	+ I hope the sacred egg\n
	+ can escape this\n
	+ danger unscathed.
     b	= \n
	+ Sand Cabana\n
	+ \n
	+ If no one's here, be\n
	+ prepared to wait for\n
	+ a loooong time.\n
     c	= \n
	+ Surf Cabana\n
	+ \n
	+ For a limited time\n
	+ only! Famous juice\n
	+ smoothies! Yummers!\n
     d	= Alert! Alert!\n
	+ Just look at the\n
	+ top of the tower!
     e	= Some weird thing has\n
	+ curled up on the\n
	+ tower to take a nap!\n
	+ This could endanger\n
	+ the legendary Sand\n
	+ Bird egg!
